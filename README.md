# Hello ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Blake, a software engineer.

I have an interest in several areas of programming: Web Development, Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence, and Games.

I work for Paper on a mix of *Vue, React, Unity, Machine Learning, and Node*.

## Always trying to learn:

I'm working on my Master of CS from Georgia Tech in *Interactive AI*. This is AI which is used by humans.

At the moment, I'm particularly interested in *Reinforcement Learning*, and relearning linear algebra.

Besides programming; I lift weights, run, ski, restore my home, have [55 Playstation platinums]([url](https://psnprofiles.com/Gilbert_Sanchez)), and love being outdoors in sunny Colorado.
