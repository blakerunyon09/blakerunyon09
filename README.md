# Hello ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Blake, a software engineer.

I have an interest in several areas of programming: web, ML/AI, and video games.

I currently work for **Paper as an SE** on a mix of Vue, React, Unity, ML, and Node. It's an awesome mix of projects :D

Also I'm working on my **Master of CS from Georgia Tech** in Interactive AI.

**Previous Courses:** AI, **Current Courses:** Game AI & Game Design.

At the moment, I'm particulary interested in **Reinforcement Learning**, and relearning linear algebra.

Besides programming, I lift weights, have over 50 platinum trophies, ski, restore my home, and love being outdoors in sunny Colorado.

Recent projects I'm proud of:

1. Frontend: Developed MicroFrontend Pattern, adopted by entire Frontend team, and used on 14 seperate projects.
2. Frontend: Created an interface for mounting, communicating with, and rendering Unity to a web browser.
3. AI Projects: American Sign Langauge classifier using dynamic time warping, image compression algorithm
4. Games: Hotdog Rocket :D
5. Backend: Transitioned my squad from Laravel to Node & Strapi
