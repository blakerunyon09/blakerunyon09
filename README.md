# Hello ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Blake, a software engineer. I was a product manager for about 6 years. Wanting to get more technical I taught myself frontend in 2019; and got my first job as a web dev. Soon after, I attended a bootcamp in 2021, where I learned React/Rails. 

I currently work for Paper as an SE working on Unity, Vue, and Node.

At the moment I'm learning game development (Unity/C#), and working towards my Masters in CS.
